Dear guest,

the goal of this small project is not to create an app that solves a real problem, but to demonstrate a small 
part of my hard skills and deep understanding of the principles of building Android applications.

This is an example of reliable, stable, and secure application built with Clean Architecture principles, using Kotlin, 
Coroutines, Hilt, Retrofit and Jetpack Compose. The project is designed to be highly testable and easily extendable.

Best regards,
Yehor Levchenko
